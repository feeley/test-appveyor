This program implements the "Gambit REPL dev" application for iOS
devices.  It is a simple development environment for Scheme.  The user
can interact with a REPL, edit/save/run small scripts, and upload
scripts to a public script repository.

This example was tested with iOS 4.3 and XCode 4.0 .  If you do not have
these versions, some adjustments will be needed at the top of the
build-gambit-iOS shell script, and possibly other places.
