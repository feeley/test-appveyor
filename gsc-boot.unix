# Due to the meta-circular nature of the system, an executable
# version of the Gambit compiler (gsc-boot) is necessary to compile
# the .scm source files that are part of the Gambit runtime library
# into .c files.  The Gambit git repository contains precompiled
# versions of these files.  When Gambit is initially built, it is
# necessary to avoid generating these .c files (since an executable
# Gambit compiler is not yet available to generate them).  This
# circular dependence is resolved by using a dummy gsc-boot script
# which does not touch the .c files obtained from the repository.
